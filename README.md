# WELCOME TO MINESWEEPER
Hello everyone, I am Aryan Bodhe, a B.Tech student at Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad, India. This project was created by me for practicing my concepts in DSA and well as for fun. The whole Program runs in terminal and currently it is the only way to interact with it. Hope you enjoy minesweeping!

## Features
- Three Difficulty Levels: Beginner, Intermediate and Expert.
- Game boards are generated by the program itself.
- Input occurs through the keyboard.
- Extensive use of Data structures and recursion.
- Formatting outputs through terminal coloring.

## To-Do 
- A mechanism is required in order to flag the cells containing mines. Currently none exists.
- Exception handling in case of input type mismatch when inputting coordinates.
- Maybe add a GUI in the distant future.
